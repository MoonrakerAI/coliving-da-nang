### Administration Data Models
```typescript
interface SystemSettings {
  id: string;
  propertyId: string;
  general: {
    timezone: string;
    currency: string;
    dateFormat: string;
    language: string;
  };
  notifications: {
    emailEnabled: boolean;
    smsEnabled: boolean;
    pushEnabled: boolean;
    reminderSchedule: number[];
  };
  integrations: {
    stripe: StripeConfig;
    email: EmailConfig;
    docusign: DocuSignConfig;
  };
  backup: {
    enabled: boolean;
    frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
    retention: number; // days
  };
}

interface AuditLog {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  action: string;
  resource: string;
  resourceId: string;
  changes: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
}

interface SystemHealth {
  timestamp: Date;
  database: {
    status: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'error';
    responseTime: number;
    connections: number;
  };
  api: {
    responseTime: number;
    errorRate: number;
    requestCount: number;
  };
  storage: {
    usage: number;
    available: number;
    percentage: number;
  };
}
```

### Security and Access Control
- Role-based access to admin functions
- Two-factor authentication for admin users
- IP whitelisting for sensitive operations
- Session timeout for admin interfaces

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List all users
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create new user
- `PATCH /api/admin/settings` - Update system settings
- `POST /api/admin/backup` - Trigger system backup
- `GET /api/admin/audit-log` - Get audit trail
- `GET /api/admin/health` - System health check

## Definition of Done
- [x] User management interface functional for all operations
- [x] Property settings can be configured and updated
- [ ] Notification preferences work correctly
- [x] System backup and export functionality operational
- [ ] External service integrations properly configured
- [x] Audit logging captures all required events
