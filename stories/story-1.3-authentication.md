- [x] Sensitive operations audit trail
- [x] Log retention and security compliance
- [x] Admin access to audit logs

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Structure
```
/lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts (NextAuth configuration)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers.ts (Authentication providers)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ permissions.ts (Role-based permissions)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts (Route protection)
/app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (auth)/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ register/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forgot-password/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reset-password/
/middleware.ts (Global auth middleware)
```

### Role Definitions
```typescript
enum UserRole {
  PROPERTY_OWNER = 'PROPERTY_OWNER',
  COMMUNITY_MANAGER = 'COMMUNITY_MANAGER', 
  TENANT = 'TENANT'
}

interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: UserRole;
  propertyIds: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Permission Matrix
- **Property Owner**: Full access to all property data and settings
- **Community Manager**: Day-to-day operations, tenant management, expense entry
- **Tenant**: View own payment status, submit maintenance requests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Role-based access control properly enforced
- [ ] Password reset functionality tested
- [ ] User invitation system functional
- [ ] Session security measures implemented
- [ ] Multi-property access control working
- [ ] Audit logging capturing all required events
- [ ] Security testing completed (basic penetration testing)

## Notes for Developer
- Use NextAuth.js v4.24.5 as specified in tech stack
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Store sensitive data (passwords) securely hashed
- Use environment variables for auth secrets
- Test all authentication flows thoroughly
- Implement proper error handling for auth failures
- Consider rate limiting for login attempts
