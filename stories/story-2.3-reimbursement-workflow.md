‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Reimbursement requests list)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [id]/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Request details)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approve/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Approval interface)
/lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reimbursements/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow.ts (Status management)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notifications.ts (Email notifications)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ payments.ts (Payment integration)
```

### Reimbursement Data Model
```typescript
interface ReimbursementRequest {
  id: string;
  expenseId: string;
  requestorId: string;
  propertyId: string;
  amount: number;
  status: ReimbursementStatus;
  requestDate: Date;
  approvedBy?: string;
  approvedDate?: Date;
  paidDate?: Date;
  paymentMethod?: string;
  paymentReference?: string;
  comments: string[];
  statusHistory: StatusChange[];
}

enum ReimbursementStatus {
  REQUESTED = 'Requested',
  APPROVED = 'Approved', 
  PAID = 'Paid',
  DENIED = 'Denied'
}
```

### Workflow State Machine
- Requested ‚Üí Approved/Denied (by property owner)
