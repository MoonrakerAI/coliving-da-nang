  propertyId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  instructions?: string;
  category: TaskCategory;
  priority: TaskPriority;
  assignedTo: string[];
  createdBy: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
  estimatedDuration?: number; // minutes
  status: TaskStatus;
  completedAt?: Date;
  completedBy?: string;
  completionNotes?: string;
  completionPhotos: string[];
  qualityRating?: number;
  recurrence?: RecurrencePattern;
  templateId?: string;
}

enum TaskCategory {
  CLEANING = 'Cleaning',
  MAINTENANCE = 'Maintenance',

  INSPECTION = 'Inspection',
  EMERGENCY = 'Emergency',
  OTHER = 'Other'
}

enum TaskPriority {
  LOW = 'Low',

}

enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING = 'Pending',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'In Progress',
  COMPLETED = 'Completed',
  OVERDUE = 'Overdue',
  CANCELLED = 'Cancelled'
}

interface RecurrencePattern {
  type: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'custom';
  interval: number;
  daysOfWeek?: number[];
  endDate?: Date;
  assignmentRotation: boolean;
}
```

### Task Automation Features
