}

interface Room {
  id: string;
  propertyId: string;
  number: string;
  type: 'Single' | 'Double' | 'Suite' | 'Studio';
  size: number; // square feet
  features: string[];
  monthlyRent: number;
  deposit: number;
  isAvailable: boolean;
  condition: 'Excellent' | 'Good' | 'Fair' | 'Needs Repair';
  lastInspection?: Date;
  photos: string[];
}

interface OccupancyRecord {
  id: string;
  roomId: string;
  tenantId: string;
  startDate: Date;
