‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ list/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (List view)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kanban/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Kanban board)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/

```

### View State Management
```typescript
interface TaskViewState {
  viewType: 'list' | 'kanban' | 'dashboard';
  filters: TaskFilters;
  sortBy: TaskSortField;
  sortOrder: 'asc' | 'desc';
  selectedTasks: string[];
  searchQuery: string;
}

interface TaskFilters {
  assignee?: string[];
  priority?: TaskPriority[];
  category?: TaskCategory[];
  status?: TaskStatus[];
  dateRange?: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
}

enum TaskSortField {
  DUE_DATE = 'dueDate',
  PRIORITY = 'priority',
  CREATED_DATE = 'createdAt',
  ASSIGNEE = 'assignedTo',
  TITLE = 'title'
}
```

### Kanban Board Features
- Drag-and-drop with React DnD or similar
- Column customization and reordering
- Task card customization
- Real-time updates for collaborative editing

### Performance Considerations
- Virtual scrolling for large task lists
- Efficient filtering and search indexing
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Proper caching for frequently accessed data

## Definition of Done
- [ ] List view displays tasks clearly with all required information
- [ ] Kanban board functional with drag-and-drop capabilities
- [ ] Filtering and sorting work efficiently with large datasets
- [ ] Task search provides relevant and fast results
- [ ] Bulk operations work reliably for multiple tasks
- [ ] Personal dashboard provides useful insights
- [ ] Performance metrics calculate accurately
- [ ] All views are responsive and mobile-friendly

## Notes for Developer
- Use Zustand v4.4.7 for view state management as per tech stack
- Implement proper loading states for all view transitions
- Test drag-and-drop functionality thoroughly
- Consider implementing keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Use proper virtualization for large task lists
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or polling
- Test performance with large numbers of tasks
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all interactive elements
