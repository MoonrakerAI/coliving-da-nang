## Technical Implementation Details

### Reporting System Structure
```
/app/reports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ expenses/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Main expense reports)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categories/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Category analysis)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trends/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Trend analysis)
/lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reporting/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categorization.ts (Auto-categorization logic)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics.ts (Trend analysis)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exports.ts (Export functionality)
/components/reports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseChart.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CategoryBreakdown.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TrendAnalysis.tsx
```

### Categorization Engine
```typescript
interface CategorySuggestion {
  category: ExpenseCategory;
  confidence: number;
  reason: 'merchant' | 'ocr' | 'pattern' | 'manual';
  suggestions: string[];
}

interface ExpenseReport {
  period: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
  totalAmount: number;
  categoryBreakdown: CategoryTotal[];
  trends: TrendData[];
  comparisons: ComparisonData[];
}
```

### Machine Learning Features
- Merchant name pattern recognition
- Historical categorization learning
- User correction feedback integration
- Confidence scoring algorithms

### Export Formats
- CSV with proper headers and formatting
- PDF with charts and visual summaries
- Excel with multiple sheets and formulas
- JSON for API integrations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Category system works with predefined and custom categories
- [ ] Automatic categorization provides useful suggestions
- [ ] Monthly and yearly reports generate accurately
- [ ] Trend analysis identifies meaningful patterns
- [ ] Export functionality works for all supported formats
- [ ] Tax-relevant flagging helps with tax preparation
- [ ] Multi-property allocation calculates correctly
- [ ] All reports load within performance requirements

## Notes for Developer
- Use Chart.js or similar for visual reporting
- Implement proper caching for report generation
- Consider using web workers for heavy calculations
- Test export functionality with large datasets
- Implement proper error handling for report failures
- Use date-fns v3.0.6 for date calculations
- Consider implementing report scheduling/automation
- Test categorization accuracy with real expense data
