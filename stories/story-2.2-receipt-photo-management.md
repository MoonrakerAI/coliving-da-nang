## Technical Implementation Details

### Photo Storage Structure
```
/lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blob.ts (Vercel Blob integration)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processor.ts (Image processing)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ocr.ts (Text extraction)
/app/api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ upload/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ receipt/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route.ts (Photo upload endpoint)
/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PhotoGallery.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PhotoViewer.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PhotoUpload.tsx
```

### Image Processing Pipeline
```typescript
interface PhotoProcessingResult {
  originalUrl: string;
  thumbnailUrl: string;
  compressedUrl: string;
  extractedText?: {
    amount?: number;
    merchant?: string;
    date?: Date;
    confidence: number;
  };
  metadata: {
    size: number;
    dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
    format: string;
  };
}
```

### Blob Storage Organization
```
/receipts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {propertyId}/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {year}/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {month}/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {expenseId}-original.jpg
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {expenseId}-compressed.jpg
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {expenseId}-thumb.jpg
```

### OCR Integration Options
- Consider Tesseract.js for client-side OCR
- Google Vision API for server-side processing
- AWS Textract for advanced receipt parsing
- Fallback to manual entry if OCR fails

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Photos upload successfully to Vercel Blob storage
- [ ] Image compression reduces file sizes appropriately
- [ ] OCR extraction provides useful text data
- [ ] Thumbnails generate correctly for all image formats
- [ ] Multiple photos per expense work seamlessly
- [ ] Photo access control properly enforced
- [ ] Photo management interface functional and intuitive
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (fast upload/viewing)

## Notes for Developer
- Use Sharp v0.33.1 for image processing as per tech stack
- Implement proper error handling for upload failures
- Consider progressive upload for large images
- Test with various image formats and sizes
- Implement proper cleanup for failed uploads
- Use environment variables for Blob storage configuration
- Consider implementing image watermarking for security
- Test OCR accuracy with various receipt types
