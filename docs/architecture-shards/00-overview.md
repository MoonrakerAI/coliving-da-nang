# Architecture Overview - Coliving Management System

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Coliving Management System, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines backend and frontend architecture concerns, streamlined for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined, particularly with Vercel's edge computing capabilities.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** Using Next.js 14 App Router template with TypeScript
**Rationale:** Provides optimal integration with Vercel platform, built-in API routes, and excellent TypeScript support for type safety across the fullstack.

**Template Setup:**
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest coliving-management --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
```

## Technical Summary

The system employs a modern serverless fullstack architecture optimized for Vercel deployment. Built on Next.js 14 with App Router, it leverages Vercel's edge functions for API endpoints, KV Redis for data persistence, and Blob storage for receipt photos. The architecture prioritizes mobile-first expense entry and automated payment management while maintaining multi-property scalability. Stripe integration handles payment processing, with email automation for tenant reminders and e-signature integration for digital agreements.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Vercel
**Key Services:** 
- Vercel Edge Functions for API endpoints
- Vercel KV (Redis) for primary data storage
- Vercel Blob for receipt photos and document storage
- Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring

**Deployment Host and Regions:** Global edge deployment with automatic regional optimization

**Rationale:** Vercel provides seamless Next.js integration, global performance optimization, and cost-effective scaling. The serverless architecture eliminates infrastructure management while providing excellent performance for the mobile-first requirements.

## Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo with Next.js App Router
**Monorepo Tool:** Native Next.js workspace (no additional tooling needed)
**Package Organization:** Single application with clear internal organization

**Rationale:** Next.js App Router provides excellent organization for fullstack applications without the complexity of multi-package monorepos. The co-location of frontend and backend code simplifies development and deployment.
