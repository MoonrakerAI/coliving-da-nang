# Technology Stack - Coliving Management System

## Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** Static site generation with serverless APIs - _Rationale:_ Optimal performance and cost efficiency for coliving management workflows
- **API-First Design:** All business logic exposed through well-defined APIs - _Rationale:_ Enables future mobile app development and third-party integrations
- **Mobile-First Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality optimized for mobile, enhanced for desktop - _Rationale:_ Expense entry happens on-the-go, primary use case is mobile
- **Event-Driven Notifications:** Email and task reminders triggered by data changes - _Rationale:_ Automates manual payment follow-up workflows
- **Multi-Tenant Data Architecture:** Property-scoped data access with role-based permissions - _Rationale:_ Supports multi-property scaling from day one
