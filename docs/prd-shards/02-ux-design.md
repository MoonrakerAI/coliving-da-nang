# User Interface Design Goals - Coliving Management System

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, Mercury.com-inspired design with intuitive navigation optimized for daily administrative tasks. The interface prioritizes speed and efficiency for frequent operations (expense entry, payment checking) while maintaining visual appeal that encourages consistent usage.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Mobile-first expense entry**: Quick photo capture with minimal form fields
- **One-screen dashboard**: All critical information visible without scrolling on desktop
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex features accessible but not cluttering primary workflows
- **Role-based interfaces**: Different views optimized for property owner vs community manager

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard**: Tenant roster, payment status, recent expenses, daily tasks overview
- **Payment Management**: Tenant payment tracking, reminder scheduling, payment method management
- **Expense Entry**: Mobile-optimized form with photo upload and categorization
- **Tenant Management**: Contact information, room assignments, agreement status
- **Task Management**: Daily/weekly chore assignments with list and kanban views
- **Reports**: Financial summaries and time-period analysis
- **Settings**: Property configuration, user roles, notification preferences

## Accessibility
WCAG AA compliance with particular attention to mobile touch targets and color contrast for outdoor expense entry scenarios.

## Branding
Mercury.com-inspired clean interface with focus on data clarity and efficient workflows. Professional appearance suitable for property management while remaining approachable for daily use.

## Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Next.js framework for full-stack development with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for consistent design system implementation
- Stripe integration for payment processing and new payment method additions
- Email service integration (Resend or similar) for automated notifications
- E-signature service integration for digital tenant agreements
