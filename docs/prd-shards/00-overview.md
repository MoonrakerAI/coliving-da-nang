# PRD Overview - Coliving Management System

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Streamline coliving space administration through automated payment tracking and reminders
- Enable real-time expense entry and tracking with mobile-first design
- Eliminate manual paperwork through digital tenant agreements and e-signatures
- Scale system architecture to support multiple property locations from day one
- Reduce administrative overhead while maintaining excellent tenant experience
- Provide clear financial visibility and reporting for business operations

### Background Context
This system addresses the operational challenges of managing a 7-bedroom coliving space with current manual processes. The biggest pain points identified are payment tracking/reminders and expense entry, which currently require significant manual overhead. The system must work seamlessly on mobile devices since expenses occur in real-time throughout the property, and must integrate with existing workflows (WhatsApp communication, Stripe payments) rather than replacing them.

The solution will deploy on Vercel platform using KV Redis for data storage and Blob storage for multimedia content, ensuring fast global performance and cost-effective scaling.
