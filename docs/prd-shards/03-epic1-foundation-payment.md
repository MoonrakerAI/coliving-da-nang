# Epic 1: Foundation & Payment Management

## Epic Goal
Establish the technical foundation and core payment management system that addresses the primary pain point of manual payment tracking and tenant reminders. This epic delivers immediate value by automating the most time-consuming administrative task while creating the infrastructure for all future features.

2. Vercel deployment pipeline configured with preview and production environments
3. KV Redis database connection established with basic schema
4. Authentication system implemented with role-based access (Owner, Manager, Tenant)
5. Basic routing structure established for main application sections
6. Development environment includes linting, formatting, and testing framework
7. Environment variables properly configured for all external services

## Story 1.2: Core Database Schema and Models
As a property owner,
I want the fundamental data models established,
so that tenant, payment, and expense information can be properly stored and retrieved.

2. Property model supporting multiple locations with configuration settings
3. Payment model tracking amounts, due dates, status, and payment methods
4. Expense model with categorization, receipt storage, and reimbursement tracking
5. User model with role-based permissions and property associations
6. Database migrations and seed data for development testing
7. Prisma ORM integration with KV Redis for optimized queries

## Story 1.3: Authentication and User Management
As a property owner,
I want secure login and role-based access control,
so that different users can access appropriate system functions safely.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Email/password authentication with secure session management
2. Role-based access control (Property Owner, Community Manager, Tenant)
3. User registration and invitation system for new team members
4. Password reset functionality via email
5. Session timeout and security policies implemented
6. Multi-property access control for scaling to additional locations
7. Audit logging for sensitive operations (payments, user management)

## Story 1.4: Payment Tracking Dashboard
As a property owner,
I want to see all tenant payment statuses at a glance,
so that I can quickly identify who needs payment reminders or follow-up.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all current tenants with payment status indicators
2. Visual indicators for paid, pending, overdue, and upcoming payments
3. Quick view of payment amounts, due dates, and payment methods used
4. Filter and sort capabilities by status, tenant, or date
5. Mobile-responsive design for checking status on-the-go
6. Real-time updates when payment status changes
7. Export capability for payment status reports

## Story 1.5: Automated Payment Reminder System
As a property owner,
I want automated email reminders sent to tenants about upcoming and overdue payments,
so that I don't have to manually track and chase payments.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated email reminders sent 7 days before payment due date
2. Follow-up reminders sent on due date and 3 days after
3. Customizable email templates with property and tenant details
4. Reminder schedule configuration per tenant or globally
5. Email delivery tracking and bounce handling
6. Manual reminder override capability for special circumstances
7. Integration with existing email systems and professional formatting

## Story 1.6: Payment Recording and Method Management
As a property owner,
I want to easily record tenant payments across multiple payment methods,
so that I can maintain accurate records regardless of how tenants pay.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Payment entry form supporting all current methods (Stripe, PayPal, Venmo, Wise, Revolut, Wire)
2. Stripe integration for new credit card and ACH payment options
3. Payment confirmation emails sent automatically to tenants
4. Payment history tracking with method, amount, date, and reference numbers
5. Batch payment processing for multiple tenants
