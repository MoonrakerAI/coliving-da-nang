# Coliving Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Streamline coliving space administration through automated payment tracking and reminders
- Enable real-time expense entry and tracking with mobile-first design
- Eliminate manual paperwork through digital tenant agreements and e-signatures
- Scale system architecture to support multiple property locations from day one
- Reduce administrative overhead while maintaining excellent tenant experience
- Provide clear financial visibility and reporting for business operations

### Background Context
This system addresses the operational challenges of managing a 7-bedroom coliving space with current manual processes. The biggest pain points identified are payment tracking/reminders and expense entry, which currently require significant manual overhead. The system must work seamlessly on mobile devices since expenses occur in real-time throughout the property, and must integrate with existing workflows (WhatsApp communication, Stripe payments) rather than replacing them.

The solution will deploy on Vercel platform using KV Redis for data storage and Blob storage for multimedia content, ensuring fast global performance and cost-effective scaling.

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, Mercury.com-inspired design with intuitive navigation optimized for daily administrative tasks. The interface prioritizes speed and efficiency for frequent operations (expense entry, payment checking) while maintaining visual appeal that encourages consistent usage.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Mobile-first expense entry**: Quick photo capture with minimal form fields
- **One-screen dashboard**: All critical information visible without scrolling on desktop
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex features accessible but not cluttering primary workflows
- **Role-based interfaces**: Different views optimized for property owner vs community manager

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard**: Tenant roster, payment status, recent expenses, daily tasks overview
- **Payment Management**: Tenant payment tracking, reminder scheduling, payment method management
- **Expense Entry**: Mobile-optimized form with photo upload and categorization
- **Tenant Management**: Contact information, room assignments, agreement status
- **Task Management**: Daily/weekly chore assignments with list and kanban views
- **Reports**: Financial summaries and time-period analysis
- **Settings**: Property configuration, user roles, notification preferences

### Accessibility
WCAG AA compliance with particular attention to mobile touch targets and color contrast for outdoor expense entry scenarios.

### Branding

### Target Device and Platforms
Web responsive with mobile-first design, optimized for iOS and Android mobile browsers for expense entry, with full desktop functionality for administrative oversight.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
Monorepo structure to manage frontend, backend API, and shared utilities in single codebase for simplified deployment and maintenance.

### Service Architecture
Serverless architecture using Vercel's edge functions for API endpoints, KV Redis for data persistence, and Blob storage for file uploads. This approach optimizes for cost efficiency and global performance.

### Testing Requirements
Unit testing for business logic, integration testing for payment workflows, and end-to-end testing for critical user journeys (payment entry, expense logging). Mobile device testing across iOS/Android browsers.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Next.js framework for full-stack development with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for consistent design system implementation
- Stripe integration for payment processing and new payment method additions
